"""
There are various special sequences you can use in regular expressions.
They are written as a backslash followed by another character.
One useful special sequence is a backslash and a number between 1 and 99, e.g.,
\1 or \17. This matches the expression of the group of that number.
Note, that "(.+) \1" is not the same as "(.+) (.+)",
because \1 refers to the first group's subexpression,
which is the matched expression itself, and not the regex pattern.
